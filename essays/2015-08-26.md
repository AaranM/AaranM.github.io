My name is Aaran Maldonado and I am currently an Accounting Major student. Very recently I decided to double major in MIS and is the reason I am taking this course right now. One reason why I am majoring in MIS is because many of my accounting friends are double majoring in MIS. I also believe that this will help me in my career as an accountant.
