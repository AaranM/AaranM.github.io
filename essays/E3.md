<b>Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details</b>

<b>Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.</b>

This WOD was the most difficult WOD yet. I really liked learning how to use expressions to dynamically change the data. One thing I stumbled on was using the ${} for the strings. I forgot to put in the ` `.

<b>Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?</b>

What I did to prepare was to go over the expression and operator readings and to look over what I did for la6. Both of these were helpful in creating the expression formulas used for the sales reciept.

<b>Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.<b/>

I think doing more research outside of class readings would help me be even more prepared
