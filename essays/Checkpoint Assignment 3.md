<b>Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. Here is an example PPT prototype</b>

<a hef="https://youtu.be/kdjZxCWZM6s"> My screencast</a>

<b>Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.</b>

I will have an 'add to cart' button in each product page where you can add selected products into the cart. Once in the cart page, I will make it so you can add or remove quantities of a products. I will also add an option to go back to the products pages and continue shopping. 

<b>Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.</b>


<b>How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?</b>

My server validates if the user has logged in or not. If the user is not logged in, they can not go to the invoice. 

<b>Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)</b>

Upon a successful login, I will add an option for the user to log out. I will also add a text saying the user is logged in.

<b>If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?</b>

I am doing this assignment by myself

<b>How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?</b>
I am approaching assignment 3 differently as in I am reading more into the documentation of codes and trying to understand how it works. Also, I have took the time to plan out how my website will be design and function.
